# sumologic_http_source
Provides a [Sumologic HTTP source][1].

__IMPORTANT:__ The endpoint is stored in plain-text in the state. This is a potential security issue.

## Example Usage

resource "sumologic_http_source" "http_source" {
  name                = "HTTP"
  description         = "My description"
  category            = "my/source/category"
  collector_id        = "${sumologic_collector.collector.id}"
  filters       {
      name = "Test Exclude Debug"
      filter_type = "Exclude"
      regexp = ".*DEBUG.*"
  }
}

resource "sumologic_collector" "collector" {
  name        = "my-collector"
  description = "Just testing this"
}
```
