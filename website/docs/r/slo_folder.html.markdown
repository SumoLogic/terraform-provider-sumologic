# sumologic_slo_folder

Provides the ability to create, read, delete, and update folders for SLO's.

## Example SLO Folder

NOTE: SLO folders are considered a different resource from Library content and monitor folders.

  name        = "Terraform Managed SLO's"
  description = "A folder for SLO's managed by terraform."
}
```

## Example Creating SLO Folders and then SLO's in them

```hcl

resource "sumologic_slo_folder" "tf_slo_folder" {
  name        = "slo-tf-folder"
  description = "folder for SLO created for testing"
  parent_id   = "0000000000000001"
}

resource "sumologic_slo" "slo_tf_test" {
  name        = "slo-tf-test1"
  description = "example SLO created for testing"
  parent_id   = sumologic_slo_folder.slo_tf_test_folder.id
 ...
```

## Example Nested SLO Folders

resource "sumologic_slo_folder" "tf_payments_team_root_folder" {
  name        = "Security Team SLOs"
  description = "SLO's payments services."
}

  name        = "Production SLOs"
  description = "SLOs for the Payments service on Production Environment."
  parent_id   = sumologic_slo_folder.tf_payments_team_root_folder.id
}

resource "sumologic_slo_folder" "tf_payments_team_stag_folder" {
  name        = "Staging SLOs"
  description = "SLOs for the payments service on Staging Environment."
  parent_id   = sumologic_slo_folder.tf_payments_team_root_folder.id
}
```
