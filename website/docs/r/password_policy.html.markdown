# sumologic_password_policy
Sets the [Sumologic Password Policy][1]. Since there is only a single password policy for an organization,
please ensure that only a single instance of such resource is defined.
The behavior for defining more than one password policy resources is undefined.

## Example Usage
```hcl
resource "sumologic_password_policy" "examplePasswordPolicy" {
  min_length = 8
  max_length = 128
  must_contain_lowercase = true
  must_contain_uppercase = true
  must_contain_digits = true
  must_contain_special_chars = true
  max_password_age_in_days = 365
  min_unique_passwords = 10
  account_lockout_threshold = 6
  failed_login_reset_duration_in_mins = 10
  account_lockout_duration_in_mins = 30
  require_mfa = false
  remember_mfa = true
}
```
