resource "sumologic_field_extraction_rule" "fieldExtractionRule" {
      name = "exampleFieldExtractionRule"
      scope = "_sourceHost=127.0.0.1"
      parse_expression = "csv _raw extract 1 as f1"
      enabled = true
}
```

## Argument reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `name` - (Required) Name of the field extraction rule. Use a name that makes it easy to identify the rule.
