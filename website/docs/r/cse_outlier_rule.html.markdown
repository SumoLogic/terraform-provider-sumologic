# sumologic_cse_outlier_rule
Provides a Sumo Logic CSE [Outlier Rule](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/cse/rules/write-outlier-rule/).

## Example Usage
```hcl
resource "sumologic_cse_outlier_rule" "outlier_rule" {
  name = "Spike in Login Failures from a User"
  enabled = true
  severity = 4
  is_prototype = false
  summary_expression = "Excessive count of failure login events identified for user: {{user_username}} based on daily historic activity"

  aggregation_functions {
    name = "current" 
    function = "count"
    arguments = ["true"]
  }
  group_by_fields = ["user_username"]
  
  window_size = "T24H"
  baseline_window_size = 604800000  
  retention_window_size = 7776000000

  floor_value = 10

  name_expression = "Spike in Login Failures from a User"
  description_expression = "Detects excessive failed login attempts for the same username based on a daily outlier standard deviation for said user. This is designed to catch both slow and quick brute force type attacks using a user specific historic baseline. The minimum floor of failures expected by default is set to 10."
  match_expression = "objectType = 'Authentication'\nAND normalizedAction = 'logon'\nAND success = false"
  deviation_threshold = 2

  entity_selectors {
    entity_type = "_username"
    expression = "user_username"
  }

  tags = ["_mitreAttackTactic:TA0006", "_mitreAttackTechnique:T1110"]
}
```
